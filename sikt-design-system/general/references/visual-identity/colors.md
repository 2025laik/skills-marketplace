# Color Palette

The Sikt color system centers on a distinctive purple palette as the dominant brand color, supplemented by supporting colors for variety and specific use cases.

## Primary Color: Purple

Purple is one of Sikt's strongest tools for creating brand identity. It serves as the key differentiator from competitors and is essential for brand recognition.

**Philosophy**: "Den lilla fargen er et av våre sterkeste virkemidler for å skape identiteten"
(Purple color is one of our strongest means of creating identity)

## Secondary/Support Colors

A supplementary palette complements the primary purple for:
- Printed materials
- Illustrations
- Social media content
- Data visualization

## Usage Guidelines

### Hierarchy
- **Primary purple colors should dominate** compositions
- **Small accents from support colors** add variety and flexibility
- Maintain visual balance with purple as the anchor

### Semantic Warnings

Be cautious with colors that carry implicit meaning:
- Orange and green in data visualization may suggest positive/negative associations unintentionally
- Consider cultural context and colorblind accessibility

### Product-Specific Approach

**Standard Products**: Must use the purple branding consistently

**Products with Strong Existing Brands**: May develop color themes based on their own brand colors while maintaining alignment with the Sikt family

## Digital Implementation

The production color system uses token-based colors for digital products:
- Brand color tokens
- Interaction color tokens (primary, secondary, tertiary)
- Feedback color tokens (success, error, warning, info)
- Text color tokens
- Surface color tokens

Refer to the design tokens documentation for specific token values and usage.

## Accessibility Considerations

All color combinations must meet WCAG contrast requirements:
- **Level AA**: Minimum 4.5:1 for normal text, 3:1 for large text
- **Level AAA (Enhanced)**: 7:1 for normal text, 4.5:1 for large text

Use tools like WebAIM Contrast Checker to verify color contrast ratios.
