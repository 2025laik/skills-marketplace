# Logo Usage Guidelines

## Logo Variants

### Primary Logo (Primærlogo)
The primary logo is displayed on most surfaces, combining the Sikt name and icon.

**Specifications:**
- Restricted to two colors: Sikt Mørk (dark) and Sikt Lys (light)
- Color choice is independent of background
- **Minimum width**: 60px (screen) | 20mm (print)

**Usage:** Default logo for most applications and contexts.

### Secondary Logo (Sekundærlogo)
Extended version with full brand name across three lines, emphasizing "Sikt" typography to balance the icon.

**Available Languages:**
- Norwegian Bokmål
- Nynorsk
- Finnish
- Samisk

**Specifications:**
- **Minimum width**: 90px (screen) | 35mm (print)

**Usage:** Formal contexts, international communications, or when additional emphasis is needed.

### Icon (Ikon)
Standalone logo mark for constrained spaces.

**Specifications:**
- **Minimum width**: 25px (screen) | 8mm (print)
- Functions in both static and animated applications

**Usage:**
- Social media profile images
- Favicons
- App icons
- Branded contexts where space is limited

## Spacing & Protection Zone

A defined protection zone surrounds all logos, scaled proportionally based on the square height within the mark.

**Rule:** "Ingen elementer skal plasseres nærmere logoikonet enn det som er definert"
(No elements should be placed closer to the logo than specified)

This ensures the logo maintains visual impact and remains uncluttered.

## Product & Service Branding

### New Sikt Products
Must incorporate the Sikt icon with service names to maintain brand consistency.

**Minimum dimensions:**
- **Print**: 6mm height
- **Screen**: Component-defined sizing

### Existing Products
Products with established visual identities transition gradually while:
- Preserving user trust during upgrades
- Modernizing interfaces incrementally
- Maintaining brand family alignment

### Products with Strong Existing Brands
May develop color themes based on their own brand colors while maintaining alignment with the Sikt family identity.

## Logo Colors

**Available Options:**
- **Sikt Mørk (Dark)**: Use on light backgrounds
- **Sikt Lys (Light)**: Use on dark backgrounds

The logo should maintain high contrast with its background for visibility and accessibility.
